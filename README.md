# Stacked PRs for GitHub

This is a command-line tool that helps you create multiple GitHub
pull requests (PRs) all at once, with a stacked order of dependencies.

Imagine that we have a change `A` and a change `B` depending on `A`, and we
would like to get them both reviewed. Without stacked PRs one would have to
create two PRs: `A` and `A+B`. The second PR would be difficult to review as it
includes all the changes simultaneously. With stacked PRs the first PR will
have only the change `A`, and the second PR will only have the change `B`. With
stacked PRs one can group related changes together making them easier to
review.

## Installation

### Dependencies

This is a non-comprehensive list of dependencies required by `stack-pr.py`:

- Install `gh`, e.g., `brew install gh` on MacOS.
- Run `gh auth login` with SSH


### Installation with `pipx`

To install via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) run:

```bash
pipx install stack-pr
```

### Manual installation from source

Manually, you can clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
pipx install .
```

## Usage

`stack-pr` allows you to work with stacked PRs: submit, view, and land them.

### Basic Workflow

The most common workflow is simple:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b my-feature
```

2. Make your changes and create multiple commits (one commit per PR you want to create)
```bash
# Make some changes
git commit -m "First change"
# Make more changes
git commit -m "Second change"
# And so on...
```

3. Review what will be in your stack:
```bash
stack-pr view  # Always safe to run, helps catch issues early
```

4. Create/update the stack of PRs:
```bash
stack-pr submit
```
> **Note**: `export` is an alias for `submit`.

5. To update any PR in the stack:
- Amend the corresponding commit
- Run `stack-pr view` to verify your changes
- Run `stack-pr submit` again

6. To rebase your stack on the latest main:
```bash
git checkout my-feature
git pull origin main  # Get the latest main
git rebase main       # Rebase your commits on top of main
stack-pr submit       # Resubmit to update all PRs
```

7. When your PRs are ready to merge, you have two options:

**Option A**: Using `stack-pr land`:
```bash
stack-pr land
```
This will:
- Merge the bottom-most PR in your stack
- Automatically rebase your remaining PRs
- You can run `stack-pr land` again to merge the next PR once CI passes

**Option B**: Using GitHub web interface:
1. Merge the bottom-most PR through GitHub UI
2. After the merge, on your local machine:
   ```bash
   git checkout my-feature
   git pull origin main  # Get the merged changes
   stack-pr submit       # Resubmit the stack to rebase remaining PRs
   ```
3. Repeat for each PR in the stack

That's it!

> **Pro-tip**: Run `stack-pr view` frequently - it's a safe command that helps you understand the current state of your stack and catch any potential issues early.

### Commands

`stack-pr` has four main commands:

- `submit` (or `export`) - create a new stack of PRs from the given set of
  commits. One can think of this as “push my local changes to the corresponding
  remote branches and update the corresponding PRs (or create new PRs if they
  don’t exist yet)”.
- `view` - inspect the given set of commits and find the linked PRs. This
  command does not push any changes anywhere and does not change any commits.
  It can be used to examine what other commands did or will do.
- `abandon` - remove all stack metadata from the given set of commits. Apart
  from removing the metadata from the affected commits, this command deletes
  the corresponding local and remote branches and closes the PRs.
- `land` - merge the bottom-most PR in the current stack and rebase the rest of
  the stack on the latest main.

A usual workflow is the following:

```bash
while not ready to merge:
    make local changes
    commit to local git repo or amend existing commits
    create or update the stack with `stack-pr.py submit`
merge changes with `stack-pr.py land`
```

You can also use `view` at any point to examine the current state, and
`abandon` to drop the stack.

Under the hood the tool creates and maintains branches named
`$USERNAME/stack/$BRANCH_NUM` (the name pattern can be customized via
`--branch-name-template` option) and embeds stack metadata into commit messages,
but you are not supposed to work with those branches or edit that metadata
manually. I.e. instead of pushing to these branches you should use `submit`,
instead of deleting them you should use `abandon` and instead of merging them
you should use `land`.

The tool looks at commits in the range `BASE..HEAD` and creates a stack of PRs
to apply these commits to `TARGET`. By default, `BASE` is `main` (local
branch), `HEAD` is the git revision `HEAD`, and `TARGET` is `main` on remote
(i.e. `origin/main`). These parameters can be changed with options `-B`, `-H`,
and `-T` respectively and accept the standard git notation: e.g. one can use
`-B HEAD~2`, to create a stack from the last two commits.

### Example

The first step before creating a stack of PRs is to double-check the changes
we’re going to post.

By default `stack-pr` will look at commits in `main..HEAD` range and will create
a PR for every commit in that range.

For instance, if we have

```bash
# git checkout my-feature
# git log -n 4  --format=oneline
**cc932b71c** (**my-feature**)        Optimized navigation algorithms for deep space travel
**3475c898f**                         Fixed zero-gravity coffee spill bug in beverage dispenser
**99c4cd9a7**                         Added warp drive functionality to spaceship engine.
**d2b7bcf87** (**origin/main, main**) Added module for deploying remote space probes

```

Then the tool will consider the top three commits as changes, for which we’re
trying to create a stack.

> **Pro-tip**: a convenient way to see what commits will be considered by
> default is the following command:
>

```bash
alias githist='git log --abbrev-commit --oneline $(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)^..HEAD'
```

We can double-check that by running the script with `view` command - it is
always a safe command to run:

```bash
# stack-pr view
...
VIEW
**Stack:**
   * **cc932b71** (No PR): Optimized navigation algorithms for deep space travel
   * **3475c898** (No PR): Fixed zero-gravity coffee spill bug in beverage dispenser
   * **99c4cd9a** (No PR): Added warp drive functionality to spaceship engine.
SUCCESS!
```

If everything looks correct, we can now submit the stack, i.e. create all the
corresponding PRs and cross-link them. To do that, we run the tool with
`submit` command:

```bash
# stack-pr submit
...
SUCCESS!
```

The command accepts a couple of options that might be useful, namely:

- `--draft` - mark all created PRs as draft. This helps to avoid over-burdening
  CI.
- `--draft-bitmask` - mark select PRs in a stack as draft using a bitmask where
    `1` indicates draft, and `0` indicates non-draft.
    For example `--draft-bitmask 0010` to make the third PR a draft in a stack
    of four.
    The length of the bitmask must match the number of stacked PRs.
    Overridden by `--draft` when passed.
- `--reviewer="handle1,handle2"` - assign specified reviewers.

If the command succeeded, we should see “SUCCESS!” in the end, and we can now
run `view` again to look at the new stack:

```python
# stack-pr view
...
VIEW
**Stack:**
   * **cc932b71** (#439, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/103' -> 'ZolotukhinM/stack/102'): Optimized navigation algorithms for deep space travel
   * **3475c898** (#438, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/102' -> 'ZolotukhinM/stack/101'): Fixed zero-gravity coffee spill bug in beverage dispenser
   * **99c4cd9a** (#437, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/101' -> 'main'): Added warp drive functionality to spaceship engine.
SUCCESS!
```

We can also go to github and check our PRs there:

![StackedPRExample2](https://modular-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/stackpr/example_1.png)

If we need to make changes to any of the PRs (e.g. to address the review
feedback), we simply amend the desired changes to the appropriate git commits
and run `submit` again. If needed, we can rearrange commits or add new ones.

`submit` simply syncs the local changes with the corresponding PRs. This is why
we use the same `stack-pr submit` command when we create a new stack, rebase our
changes on the latest main, update any PR in the stack, add new commits to the
stack, or rearrange commits in the stack.

When we are ready to merge our changes, we use `land` command.

```python
# stack-pr land
LAND
Stack:
   * cc932b71 (#439, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/103' -> 'ZolotukhinM/stack/102'): Optimized navigation algorithms for deep space travel
   * 3475c898 (#438, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/102' -> 'ZolotukhinM/stack/101'): Fixed zero-gravity coffee spill bug in beverage dispenser
   * 99c4cd9a (#437, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/101' -> 'main'): Added warp drive functionality to spaceship engine.
Landing 99c4cd9a (#437, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/101' -> 'main'): Added warp drive functionality to spaceship engine.
...
Rebasing 3475c898 (#438, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/102' -> 'ZolotukhinM/stack/101'): Fixed zero-gravity coffee spill bug in beverage dispenser
...
Rebasing cc932b71 (#439, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/103' -> 'ZolotukhinM/stack/102'): Optimized navigation algorithms for deep space travel
...
SUCCESS!
```

This command lands the first PR of the stack and rebases the rest. If we run
`view` command after `land` we will find the remaining, not yet-landed PRs
there:

```python
# stack-pr view
VIEW
**Stack:**
   * **8177f347** (#439, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/103' -> 'ZolotukhinM/stack/102'): Optimized navigation algorithms for deep space travel
   * **35c429c8** (#438, 'ZolotukhinM/stack/102' -> 'main'): Fixed zero-gravity coffee spill bug in beverage dispenser
```

This way we can land all the PRs from the stack one by one.

### Specifying custom commit ranges

The example above used the default commit range - `main..HEAD`, but you can
specify a custom range too. Below are several commonly useful invocations of
the script:

```bash
# Submit a stack of last 5 commits
stack-pr submit -B HEAD~5

# Use 'origin/main' instead of 'main' as the base for the stack
stack-pr submit -B origin/main

# Do not include last two commits to the stack
stack-pr submit -H HEAD~2
```

These options work for all script commands (and it’s recommended to first use
them with `view` to double check the result). It is possible to mix and match
them too - e.g. one can first submit the stack for the last 5 commits and then
land first three of them:

```bash
# Inspect what commits will be included HEAD~5..HEAD
stack-pr view -B HEAD~5
# Create a stack from last five commits
stack-pr submit -B HEAD~5

# Inspect what commits will be included into the range HEAD~5..HEAD~2
stack-pr view -B HEAD~5 -H HEAD~2
# Land first three PRs from the stack
stack-pr land -B HEAD~5 -H HEAD~2
```

Note that generally one doesn't need to specify the base and head branches
explicitly - `stack-pr` will figure out the correct range based on the current
branch and the remote `main` by default.

## Command Line Options Reference

### Common Arguments

These arguments can be used with any subcommand:

- `-R, --remote`: Remote name (default: "origin")
- `-B, --base`: Local base branch

### Config files

Default values for command line options can be specified via a config file.
Path to the config file can be specified via `STACKPR_CONFIG` envvar, and by
default it's assumed to be `.stack-pr.cfg` in the current folder.

An example of a config file:

```cfg
